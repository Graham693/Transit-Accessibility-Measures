# All Project Logs by Week

The team will document (summarize) their overall project progress on a weekly basis, linking it to key project deliverables. 

Place your weekly status updates in this folder before your weekly meeting.

***

**Structure:** 

- We can use as single project log file where all updates are logged. 
- Updates are name tagged which can be aggregated to create indivudual logs.
- This way we can see all the work being done in 1 file, not 4.
