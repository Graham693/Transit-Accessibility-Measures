# All Project Logs

**Original Instructions:** 
- Create a folder for each team member.  Each member will document and summarize their activities on a weekly (ongoing) basis.

**Proposed Method:** 
- We use a single large log file where each project update can be logged. Name tags can be associated to each update and aggregated to create indivudual logs. This way we can see all the work being done in 1 file, not 4.
